# SAS project

My team and I are currently working on the project that is from SAS institute on the topic “Optimization of customer lists for communication using mathematical modeling”. 

One of the most popular tasks of predictive analytics is to find the best offer for the client (“Next Best Offer”). However, in order to make the most suitable offer, it is necessary to do some work with data. In our project we will cover all these stages: from doing analytical clustering to choosing a specific offer for the client. Also, we are going to consider a method for detecting groups of goods characterized by mutual influence on each other in terms of volume of demand (Market Basket Analysis) using Machine Learning methods. 

In modern industry segmentation of clients task is common because it helps to understand the needs of different customers groups, thus company may create special offers for segments of clients to increase their profit. This method can be applied for various industries, including retail, entertainment, banking industry. Therefore it is a very relevant topic of research. In our situation, we work on educational project, that is why provided data is not from real company, but we have to work with it and provide business recommendations according to our research on clients as it was real company.

There are several main goals in project, including:
1. Clean data and analyze it.

2. Using the results of constructed mathematical models identify customer segments that are most likely to make an order of a good from category.

3. Choosing the best personalized offer for the each profile (Next Best Offer).

4. Building a joint purchase model based on transactional data for customers (Market Basket Analysis).

#### I uploaded my Jupyter notebooks for this project to this repository.
